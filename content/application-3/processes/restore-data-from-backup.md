If there is a loss of data from the Datastore it can be restored from a backup.

A backup of the following kinds is taken twice a day (in Prod) at 7am and 5pm to reflect the overnight jobs and intraday updates.

Since the backup will be out of date it may be necessary to request a rerun of the data feed.
