## Is there a bigger issue?

Join and check the following channels

- [#topic-major-incident-comms](https://link/to/slack)
- [#topic-ops-bridge](https://link/to/slack)
- [#team-platform](https://link/to/slack)

Read and gain and understand what is happening so you have context, if there is a major incident(MI) in progress. Participate and add relevant notes, e.g.
`Application-2 received a 5xx alert at xx:xx`

If there is no MI, keep investigating the Application-2 issue.

You will need to determine if Application-2 is the cause of the problem or suffering symptoms because of a dependency issue.

## Checking Application-2

### Rule in/out our application

Check the [4 golden signals dashboard](https://link/to/dashboard)

Is there:

- A sustained drop in traffic and availability?
- Has latency risen?
- Is CPU usage growing?
- Is Memory saturation growing
- Has the number of replicas spiked up or down? Has it remained there?
